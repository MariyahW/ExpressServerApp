## üí≠ How it works <a name = "working"></a>

The bot first extracts the word from the comment and then fetches word definitions, part of speech, example and source from the Oxford Dictionary API.

If the word does not exist in the Oxford Dictionary, the Oxford API then returns a 404 response upon which the bot then tries to fetch results form the Urban Dictionary API.

The bot uses the Pushshift API to fetch comments, PRAW module to reply to comments and Heroku as a server.

The entire bot is written in Python 3.6
